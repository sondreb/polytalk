## Updates

0.0.3 - "Keep screen on" at the bottom of words will keep the screen on your device on while you are learning. This is useful for when you are learning a language and don't want the screen to turn off.

0.0.2 - Added automatic opening of last language selection. This gives a much more pleasant experience for returning users. Added link to Microsoft Store on home.

0.0.1 - Initial release with 39 languages supported. Available on Microsoft Store.

## Blog Section

The app now includes a 'Blog' section focused on language, cultures, learning basic translations, and travel logs. The blog section includes:

* Articles on effective language learning techniques
* Tips for memorizing vocabulary and grammar rules
* Reviews of language learning apps and tools
* Interviews with polyglots and language experts
* Articles about cultural customs and traditions from different countries
* Travel guides and tips for language learners

* Recommendations for cultural events and festivals
* Lists of essential phrases and vocabulary for travelers
* Practical language guides for specific situations (e.g., ordering food, asking for directions)
* Audio recordings of native speakers pronouncing common phrases
* Interactive language exercises and quizzes

Blog content is managed as static files within the `src/assets/blog` directory, with each blog post as a markdown file.
